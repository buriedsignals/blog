# Now

### Here’s what I’m up to right now.

- Running a non-profit organisation called [Wallrunners](wallrunners.org), we're opening parkour schools in conflict areas. <br />
- Writing and animating a short story about a galactic ambassador's daughter called Stella. Expecting the first three chapters to be released in February. <br />
- Focusing on visual blogging as an outlet to practice ongoing learning in web development, 3D and graphics editing. Thoroughly enjoying the semi-professional excuse to dive into rabbit holes long left unattended. 
- Experimenting with D3, React and Three.js. I'll be using the same libraries to start an interactive climate publication with a friend, bringing attention to widespread corporate bullshit. <br />
- Occasionally taking on new clients as an indepent consultant. <br />
- Being consistent with my spiritual practice in turbulent times, exercising religiously to keep a positive mindset.
