### Here’s what I’m up to right now.

- Running a non-profit organisation called [Wallrunners](wallrunners.org), we open parkour schools in conflict areas. <br />
- Writing and animating a short story about a galactic ambassador's daughter called Stella. Expecting the first three chapters to be released in February. <br />
- Focusing on visual blogging as an outlet to practice ongoing technical trainings in programming, 3D and graphics editing. It's also a good excuse to procrastinate and dive into rabbit holes too long left unattended. Experimenting with D3, React and Three.js, using Jekyll and Idyll. Using the same tools I'm planning to start an interactive climate science publication with a friend to put a spotlight on widespread corporate bullshit. <br />
- Occasionally taking on new clients as an indepent consultant. <br />
- Being consistent with my spiritual practice in turbulent times, exercising religiously to keep a positive mindset.
