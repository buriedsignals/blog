Hi there,
    
For the past four years I’ve been dedicating a day a week to helping businesses and non-profits build content production and 
digital marketing capabilities as an independent consultant. The focus and length of these collaborations will vary based on 
your audience and organisational priorities, we decide together whether your expected outcomes will be solved with a website 
makeover or the implementation of a fully-fledged content and platform strategy. 

By working with me you also gain access to a network of experienced artists, designers, composers and developers with 
whom I’ve been working over the years. For each project we’ll select the right talent together. 

I’ve been interested in the web, film and storytelling since I was young. Crowdfunding my first documentary about adventurers 
on Everest and in the arctic when I was 19, moving on to work as a creative producer and filmmaker for Red Bull and North Kingdom. 
Over the past decade I progressed from operating as a solo-shooter and photographer to leading multi-disciplinary teams on film, 
web and XR productions. You’ll often find me at the intersection of independent journalism, philosophy, narrative interaction 
and digital media. 

I’m always happy to meet people over coffee or a call! You can reach me on [Twitter](twitter.Com/buriedsignals), [Linkedin](linkedin.com/tomvaillant), or by [email](mailto: tom.vaillant@icloud.com).
