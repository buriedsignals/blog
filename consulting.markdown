# Consulting

## Hello there!
    
For the past four years I’ve been dedicating at least a day a week to my practice as an independent consultant, helping businesses and non-profits build content production and digital marketing capabilities. I specialize in content and platform production, which often requires that I design digital strategy roadmaps. 

The focus and length of these collaborations varies widely depending on strategic priorities and long-term objectives. We decide together whether your needs can be solved with swift design solutions, regular strategic input, or full-on practical implementation where I join the team for a period of time. 

By working with me you also gain access to a network of experienced artists, designers, composers and developers I’ve worked with repeatedly. We select the most suitable candidates for your project together. 

I’ve been interested in the web, film and storytelling since I was young. Crowdfunding my first documentary about adventurers on Everest and in the arctic when I was 19, subsequently working as a creative producer and filmmaker for Red Bull and North Kingdom. Over the past decade I've grown from operating as a solo-shooter and photographer to leading multi-disciplinary teams on film, web and XR productions. 

I’m always happy to meet people over coffee or a call! You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/buriedsignals), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomvaillant/), or by [email](mailto: tom.vaillant@icloud.com).
